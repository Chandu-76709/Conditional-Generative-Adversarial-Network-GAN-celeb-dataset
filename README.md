# Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-celeb-dataset
This project is essentially a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images, specifically leveraging the CelebA dataset. Youâ€™re building a neural network that can create images of faces based on interpolations between different classes. Pretty cutting-edge stuff! ðŸŽ¨
